/* Step 2 (4 pts). 

If player did not win or lose in step 1 (i.e. a goal was set), continue rolling 
both dice until one of two outcomes: 1) player rolls a 7 and loses one credit or 2) player rolls the 
goal value and wins one credit. Current round ends. Set goal to -1 and output credits. Submit for 
grading to confirm 5 tests pass. */
